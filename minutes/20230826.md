# RSC Meeting 2023-08-26

Attending: Daniel, Geoffrey, Liz, Nick, Vadim, Richard

## Online Raku Conference on 28 October

Agreed on submitting a proposal for a Q&A with the RSC

## EU Open Source Law

Richard will talk to Salve and report back on what the RSC and/or TPRF could do to help

## Bill Of Materials

Discussed on what the Raku Community would need to do to provide verifiable Bill Of Materials for Rakudo and for ecosystem modules.  Geoffry will open up a Problem Solving issue for this.

## SQLite

As the Raku ecosystem is growing, JSON may not be the best "database" to query for installable modules.  An alternative could be using SQLite, but should that be at the Rakudo level using NativeCall, or at the VM level (aka, as part of MoarVM and/or JVM?).  No conclusion was reached.
