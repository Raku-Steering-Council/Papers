# RSC meeting 2026-01-03

Attending: Liz, Richard, Geoffrey, John

Discussion was had about the (lack of) handling of problem solving issues
by the Raku Steering Council.  After some brainstorming and discussion, it
was felt like a good idea to attempt more interaction with the community
on resolving these issues.

So it was decided to organize an online meeting on the 17th of January 2026,
at 19:00 UTC (8pm CET, 2pm Eastern, 11am Pacific) for maximum of 1 hour, and
try to tackle all the problem solving issues currently marked "Documentation".

This should be announce on all the usual channels such as #raku (IRC and
Discord), Rakudo Weekly and a blog post on dev.to.
