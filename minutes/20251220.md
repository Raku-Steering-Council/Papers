# RSC meeting 2025-12-20

Attending: Liz, Richard, Geoffrey, Nick, John
Guest: Vadim

## Thank you, Vadim
Vadim Belman (vrurg) was thanked for his contributions to the Raku Programming Language in general, and the Raku Steering Council in particular.

## Another departure
Stefan Seifert (nine) has indicated that it felt it was time for him to leave the Raku Steering Council: "I'm not even a reasonably active core member anymore and my work simply takes me elsewhere".

Again it was discussed what action to take: it was decided that no replacement would be sought, with the forming of a Raku Foundation even nearer.  And to re-consider the situation in 6 months should that be necessary.
