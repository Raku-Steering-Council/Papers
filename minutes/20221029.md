# RSC Meeting 2022-10-29

Attending: Daniel, Geoff, JJ, Liz, Nick, Stefan, Vadim


## TPF name change to TPRF

* The messaging is confusing and might imply that The Raku Foundation might be getting replaced by this new The Perl and Raku Foundation
* The Raku Foundation - used when raku specific; The Perl Foundation - used when perl specific; YAS - named supposed to be used for something non-language specific
    * People didn't like using the name YAS, so people used The Perl Foundation name instead
    * People didn't like The Perl Foundation being used with raku stuff
    * The Perl and Raku Foundation was thus meant to be a replacement name of YAS
* It wasn't clear The Perl and Raku Foundation was meant to replace YAS, not The Perl Foundation or The Raku Foundation
* Liz will write a blog post explaining what was meant, and will pass this on to the RSC for comments / vetting before posting

## RakuAST

* Put behind `use experimental`


## Advent Calendar

* Needs more articles
