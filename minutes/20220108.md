# RSC Meeting 2022-01-08

Attending: Geoff, JJ, Liz, Nick, Stefan


## Quick AI/Project updates

* Agenda management
  * **AI: Find some non-Google way to share scratch doc**
* Infra
  * Draft policy doc: no progress
  * Misc AIs: Infra team had cross-training, working through AI backlog
* FOSDEM
  * 11 presentations scheduled in our room + 1 in another room
  * **AI: Andrew Shitov to get us info on video delivery**
* Rakudo PR clearout
  * "Quite a lot" cleared -- from 4 pages of PRs to just over 2
* New Maintainer for Rakudo Star
  * And there was much rejoicing ...
* Open Build Service based testing
  * There is a grant for this, but it may have stalled
  * **AI: Ping for status on this**


## Raku Community Modules ecosystem migration

* **DONE** fez: group quorum support
* Small community modules adopted into common outside repo
  * *AI owner could not make it; update next meeting*
* zef/mi6 conversion for remaining community modules
  * Two modules done so far: `Slang::Roman` and `Die`
  * Generate README from Pod6 (mi6 default) or authoritative README?
    * Keep existing README if it is authoritative and there is no Pod6
    * Otherwise if no README, or README identical to Pod6, switch to mi6 style
  * Other commonly needed changes
    * Adding Changes and dist.ini
    * Updating file extensions to `.raku*`


## Advent retrospective

* Good response: 30K visits, as much as previous two years combined
* Most visits: "Unix philosophy without left-pad" and "Ethereum signatures"
* Got every post on time, except one that got converted to a FOSDEM presentation
  * Though a few were close to deadline
* We should start earlier next year to not be so close
  * We don't want to turn down or waste volunteer work
  * But we do want more opportunity to give feedback and iterate


## GitHub Actions Docker container

* Make it easy to have everything in place for GitHub Actions CI
* WIP; initial version pretty much working now
  * **AI: Post about this**
  * **AI: Docker container for Blin**


## Rakudo PRs

* Should we require Blin or Greppable6 before potentially-breaking PRs?
  * We should have an easy way for people to kick off a run against a PR
    * Right now such a policy is not really tenable otherwise
  * **AI: Make Blin CI-able from PR**
    * Blin currently takes 2.5 hours or so
    * Don't want to put this effort on submitters (don't make PRs harder!)
    * Should be automatic or at worst an easy click by reviewer
* There are some things still completely untested that are Rakudo-specific
  * We could make it a policy that all Rakudo-specific bits are tested in the
    Rakudo test suite
  * There are some risks here -- not least "legitimizing" use of internals
  * OTOH at least we'd have a better chance of knowing when we broke ourselves
* Supposed internals: NQP and metamodel and world object and such
  * Lots of all of these used in modules anyway
  * We may need more official exposure of the functionality people are wanting


## BackPAN for Raku

* Planned as a presentation for FOSDEM
* Want to move BackPAN modules to Raku organization
  * Need to check for license compliance for this case?
  * We believe most module licenses are computer-readable
  * **AI: Check current license status of each backpan module**
* We have to make sure it doesn't cause problems for zef to be JSON parsing
  potentially a whole lot of package info
  * **AI: BackPAN and zef folks to discuss**
