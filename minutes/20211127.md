## Rakudo compile times

* Performance has overall been really flat until very recently
* For years Rakudo's compile *speed* was essentially unchanging
  * Only changes in compile time have been growth in source code size and
    access to faster machines
* Rakudo's biggest performance problem has been parse time
  * Until we do real grammar engine optimization, we can't win that much
* RakuAST changes the Grammar engine
* But we also have the problem that we are running the primary Raku Grammar in NQP
  * Do we rewrite the NQP version, or port entirely to Raku?
* Current version of Match type is not very optimizeable, because the current
  implementation of Capture markers gets in the way
* Architect sees this as definite future work, but other changes come first
  * Are any previous grammar engine folks interested in touching this again?


## Nailgun/Railgun-equivalent

* Resident server that can be requested to do work, to avoid startup time for
  short scripts
* This work may actually be difficult, because it suffers from similar problems
  to doing script precompiles
  * There is a lot of global-to-each-MoarVM-instance state
  * There is a possibility to use fork (`nqp::fork`) at startup, as long as you
    haven't started user threads at the fork point
  * This is research project level work
* Might be even more useful to finish necessary work to cache precompile
  scripts, not just modules
* Rakudo's pure startup time on MoarVM is 150-200ms, which is well into
  human-noticeable range
* The actual currently perceived startup time is the time to run a 3-4 line
  script (as opposed to the empty script), because that's the current length of
  boilerplate to load an "App" module and start it from a non-precompiled script


## Release management and CI testing

* Vadim willing to help with someone running Blin
  * This might take some pressure off a potential RM
* Someone had volunteered access to an M1 Mac
* Problem with Blin on M1 is requirement for pre-compiled bisection binaries
  * We need to do compiles of all relevant versions, and somewhere to store them
* Support for different platforms
  * Tier 1/2/3 platform support?
    * Tier 1 -- platform failure is considered a release blocker
    * Tier 2 -- supported, but won't block a release
    * Tier 3 -- maybe this works?
    * Below that, totally unsupported
* Can we leverage our Azure CI for Windows support?
  * Difficult to do live debugging of failures
* AppVeyor for CI for Windows
  * Seems to work pretty well for Raku Docs team
* We have limited CI on Mac
  * We should take advantage of GitHub Actions to test on Mac
  * Problems with OpenSSL on Mac
  * Mac doesn't support `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` any more apparently?
    * Need to symlink libraries from installed locations to ~/lib of test user
    * **AI: Write up the magic to make all this work**


## In memoriam

* **AI: Fill in more of DHA entry**


## Advent Calendar

* **AI: PLEASE SUBMIT ARTICLES**
* Currently only 10 out of 24 complete
* Some RSC folks would be able to write backup articles, but don't want to do
  them all themselves
* Most successful article historically: Why Raku is good for solving Advent of Code puzzles


## Meeting schedule

* Next meeting (first half of December) still will happen as usual
* Following meeting (second half of December) will be skipped for the holidays
* Then will start up again as usual in early January
