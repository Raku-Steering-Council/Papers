# RSC meeting 2024-11-16

Attending: Liz, Vadim, Daniel, Richard

* Rainbow Butterfly Award again
  * We'd like to do nominations by Dec 1, then vote/deliberate
  * Decision announced in January, likely

* Release manager
  * Justin DeVuyst won't be able to do the 2024.11 release, but
    may be able to do the 2024.12 release
  * Should we skip a release, or go to a 2-monthly cycle?  No,
    for now try to keep to a monthly cycle as it will allow finding
    and fixing any regressions easier
  * We need more people to be able to do releases
  * Liz will contact some people to see whether they can do the
    2024.11 release.  Should this fail, then maybe we need to skip
    the 2024.11 release

* Software Bill of Materials, more generally security
  * The Raku Steering Council is inviting all who are interested
    in securing the Raku Programming Language and its implementations
    to let themselves be known by sending an email to security@raku.org

* RakuDoc v2.0
  * Richard will create a PR to remove the DOC phaser from the
    RakuDoc v2.0 definition
