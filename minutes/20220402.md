# RSC Meeting 2022-04-02

Attending: Daniel, Geoff, JJ, Liz, Nick, Stefan, Vadim


## YAS Prospectus

* For corporations that want to donate to TPF/TRF/YAS
* Bullet point summaries both for future plans and for past achievements
* Drafts for both summaries circulated to RSC, collecting feedback
* To be finalized by our next RSC meeting


## Doc Threads

### Current situation

* Some people believe current doc site is out of date
  * There is at least general agreement that there are a lot of problems
  * ... but not necessarily how they should be addressed and when
* One volunteer has built a major overhaul
  * Huge amount of work done already
  * But wanted to make many changes at once:
    * Redesign, UX, source templating, deployment method, etc.
* Other folks wanted to do only single changes at a time
* Recent discussions have gone around in circles and then fell apart
* Direct connection been JJ and major volunteer led to compromise
  * Doc source compatibility between before and after will be maintained
  * New site will go up as a new beta
  * People will be pointed at the new site
* Lots of details decided, but RSC needs to decide on:
  * Domain for the beta doc site
  * Do we need a "manager" specifically for the docs site(s)?
* We have a LOT of open issues on the doc site right now (hundreds)
  * Many of these are for content
  * These are not being addressed in any systematic way
* Right now there is really only one person who can successfully generate
  the full doc site, because of use of a deprecated code highlighting engine


### Discussion from RSC folks

* Some would like to have a plan to move at some point away from having
  permanently multiple official sites
* The precedent of raku.land versus m.r.o has shown us that community-built
  sites can *effectively* replace "official" sites anyway
* There a lot of use cases that the current docs system doesn't handle
  * ... and it seems to miss the mark of its own target audience
  * Though maybe the reality is that the docs have lots of different target
    audiences and people coming from different other language communities,
    expecting different things from docs
* We should also be careful that serving both beginners and advanced users
  is difficult to do at all well for both at once
  * We could have a "beginner book" format, with links to the "how it really
    works underneath" docs
* Things like IDEs want to be able to on-the-fly use the doc information, not
  the page renderings
* Comparison to major web sites that when they change design, offer an
  'old.foo.com' that keeps the old design for those who prefer it
  * This absolutely requires compatible *data* to be scalable at all
    * ... and a compatible (or reasonably mappable) URL namespace
  * Since this kind of thing is likely to happen more than once, we'd need
    a naming convention that would allow multiple versions
    * docs.$name.raku.org ?
  * Perhaps multiple versions in community, but only one is "official"?
* Offline documentation needs some attention
  * ... as discovered when our site was unreachable
  * github.com/rakudocs.github.io has a generated version of the current static
    site
    * Also https://rakudocs.github.io
* Dynamic versus static (but generated) site
  * Static valuable from security point of view
  * Dynamic allows some capabilities that are otherwise difficult
  * Dynamic site might be slower without significant caching/precomp
    * In which case, almost a return to static site anyway
    * But we've actually gotten this working decently for the irclogs already
  * Could also do static *pages*, but provide an API that other sites
    can use
* Generally content is our biggest *overall* problem
  * It is hard to get more people to fill in all the gaps in the content
  * The depth of Raku means there's a lot to do
  * We don't have corporate sponsorship for docs
  * A better doc site that is easier to work with can encourage people
    * People want to be able to very easily do edits, not needing to fork and PR
  * What about TRF grants for building docs?
    * What about converting our GSOD applications into an RSC grant proposal?
    * That way people don't need to risk putting lots of effort into
      applying for a grant with no idea of probability of success
* People contributing new features have a problem dealing with version/release
  dependent doc changes
  * There may be value to having "releases" of the doc tree, in sync with
    Raku/Rakudo releases, specifically so people can PR into the future release
  * At least want to be able to plan that important feature changes have docs
    by the time they are released into the wild
* **AI: Split static Pod6 content from other parts of the existing docs repo**
  * Need an additional side discussion to go through details of how
* **AI: TRF grant proposal**
* **AI: Problem-solving PR suggesting naming**
