# RSC Meeting 2024-01-13

Attending: Liz, Richard, Geoffrey, Nick, Vadim, Daniel, Stefan

## Richard Hainsworth joins the Community Affairs Team

Although Richard was already a member of the Raku Steering Council, he
was formally not yet a member of the Community Affairs Team yet.

## Issue #57

[Issue #57](https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Steering-Council/issues/57)
was discussed in the RSC and the CAT.  A conclusion was reached, which
will be formalized in an official announcement later this week.

## Discord bridging to #raku-dev and #moarvm

It was decided that there is no added value to having the #raku-dev
and #moarvm IRC channels bridged from Discord.  Liz will contact the
runner of "discord-raku-bot" to no longer bridge to these channels.
