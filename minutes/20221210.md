# Raku Steering Council 2022-12-10

Attending: Vadim, Daniel, JJ, Liz, Geoff

* Google non-profit account application
  * Some required account details unclear
  * raku.org needs a TRF page that we can link to in our application
    * raku.foundation redirects to raku.org front page now
    * Should have it redirect to TRF page when that is ready
  * Need to decide on nonprofit categorization, which doesn't have
    open source as an available option

* Problems with screen casting quality for Raku training, etc.
  * Does YAS have a paid streaming/meeting recording account (e.g. Zoom?)
    * Yes, on a couple different services
    * YAS representative to talk to YAS board about getting us access
  * Talk to organizer of The Raku Conference about the streaming setup for that

* Many thanks to JJ for his service to the RSC council!
  * Transitioning off RSC at end of year
  * Will continue in the Raku community: Advent Calendar, etc.

* Infra team
  * Two new volunteers so far, more welcome!
  * One transition meeting done so far, very active email threads
  * Next infra team meeting December 28
  * Discussing funding for hosting costs with YAS board

* New doc site
  * Docker image is done
  * Needs server and DNS setup

* Merging RakuAST
  * main branch, here we come!
  * JJ to provide GitHub action to error on pushes to old master branch
  * Project to document RakuAST beginning
  * We need to figure out the `use experimental` hook before next release

* ACLs for administrative accounts for services used by Raku
  * We should use "role groups" if *possible* on a given service
  * If that concept is not available, then we have two choices:
    * Common shared admin account
    * Individual accounts with admin rights (preferred)
  * Make sure we have enough meta-admins ("owners") on each service
