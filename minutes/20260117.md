# RSC meeting 2026-01-17

Attending: Liz, Richard, Geoffrey, John

This meeting was basically a debrief about the "Raku Resolutions" aka
"Resolve-a-thon" that was had in the hour before the meeting.

The consensus was that it had been a good meeting, with more attendance
than was expected (up to 12 at one time).  And that it is a good idea
to repeat this setup before the next RSC meeting.

It was noted that in two weeks, FOSDEM will be happening, which at
least 2 of the attending RSC members will attending, making it impossible
to attend an online meeting.

The decision was made to plan the next Resolve-a-thon at 7 February, one
week *after* FOSDEM.
