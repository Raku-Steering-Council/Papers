# RSC Meeting 2022-09-03

Attending: Daniel, Geoff, JJ, Liz, Nick, Stefan, Vadim


## Development Momentum

* Language release would potentially garner attention
    * Not likely to release this year
    * People likely waiting on raku ast to happen to write stuff using it
    * Need more people to contribute to ast related development
* Make onboarding new developers easier... maybe start with the wiki
* Need more core hackers / developers
    * Something like the NQP workshop from the past could lower the bar for core hacking
    * Core developer conference
        * not likely possible this year
        * but would help to teach / collaborate core hacking
    * Need to promote raku ast development, but may feel unapproachable
    * Document the low hanging fruit so people can easier find stuff to work on, such as raku ast
    * Possible that rakudo already does enough of what they need that core development doesn't become a priority / passion?
    * Additional publicity / PR; Ideally have a large e.g. corporate user


## Rakudo packaging

* Many os distros have out of date rakudo, but we could improve the situation
* Daniel is creating an informational document on the subject


## Hacktoberfest

* Need to get ready / setup Rakudo repo, Rakudo community modules repo, etc
* Document for converting Rakudo community modules to fez


## Advent Calendar

* Need to prepare to solicit for advent calender articles
