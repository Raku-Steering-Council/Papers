# RSC Meeting 2024-01-27

Attending: Liz, Richard, Geoffrey, Nick, Vadim, Daniel

## Large Raku codebases

A discussion was had about Raku's compilation performance with regards to large codebases, and how parallelizing pre-compilation could be a solution.  Vadim's concurrent hash access tracker in MoarVM has at least provided evidence of one unknown very rare race condition.

## Security issues

The email address security at raku.org was added for people to report security issues with Raku ecosystem modules, as well as Raku in general.

## Draig

It was agreed that the Welsh localization of Raku should become part of the official Raku L10N package.
