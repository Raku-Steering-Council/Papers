# RSC meeting 2025-12-06

Attending: Liz, Richard, Geoffrey, Daniel

Vadim Belman has indicated that he can no longer find the time to attend meetings and would therefore relinquish his seat on the Raku Steering Council.  The attendees considered two primary alternatives to handle the situation:

1. set up a new RSC election
2. suggest a number of people to ask to take Vadim's place

Since the final stages of the forming of a Raku Foundation are near, and that this will have its own election procedure, it was decided to go for option number 2.

As soon as a new candidate is found, this will be made known to the community.
