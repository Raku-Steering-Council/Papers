# RAKU INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT LIST

This paper is intended to hold a list of Raku infrastructures projects where
maintainers are looking for volunteers to join them in their duties.

## Adding A Project To The List

To add a project to this list a maintainer must open a PR with necessary
addition to this paper. A new project entry must be added under the _PROJECT
LIST_ section and contain the following elements:

1. Project title. It must be a second-level markdown heading like: _## IRC Bot
   For Something_
2. Brief project description.
3. Perhaps a few words on what kind of help is required.
4. Maintainer contact information. This could be anything that would allow a
   volunteer to get in touch with you: an email (though don't forget to take
   necessary measures to complicate spammers life), an IRC handle, a social
   network contact, etc.

For example, a new entry may look like this:

```
