# First Rainbow Butterfly Award Winner

And the winner is *Oleksander Kiryuhin* (aka `sena_kun` aka `Altai-man`).

The Rainbow Butterfly Award is awarded to Oleksander for their tireless efforts as release manager of the Raku Programming Language for two years (2020-2021), and their work on getting a more functional Raku documentation in general, and a better documentation web site in particular.

And generally being available helping people with questions regarding Raku, Cro and/or Comma on IRC and elsewhere.

We thank Oleksander for their work and hope to see more of it, especially in these difficult times where his hometown of Kherson (Херсо́н) is still under siege.
