11 November 2020 update on Raku Steering Council status
-------------------------------------------------------

The remaining council members have asked Patrick Spek, aka tyil (the next person in the election with regards to number of votes) if they'd be willing to take a seat in the council.  They affirmed that they would.

The remaining council members then took a vote whether to accept Patrick Spek into the Raku Steering Council.  This vote was unanimously accepted.

Therefore the current Raku Steering Council now consists of (in alphabetical order):

- Vadim Belman
- Nick Logan
- Elizabeth Mattijsen
- JJ Merelo
- Stefan Seifert
- Daniel Sockwell
- Patrick Spek
