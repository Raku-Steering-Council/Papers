# A community member is banned from Raku Community spaces.

The Community Affairs Team (CAT) has decided to ban Marton Polgar (via @2colours or @nemokosch or whatever other accounts or identities he creates) for two years from the date of the publication of this decision from all Raku related spaces. Marton Polgar has repeatedly, over a lengthy period of time, violated the Raku Code of Conduct. This pattern of behavior poses a danger to the Raku Community. The Community Affairs Team decided the prolonged pattern warranted the length of the ban.

The CAT considers the first paragraph of the Code of Conduct to be very important to the health of the Raku community.

>The Raku community is committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, safe, and enjoyable environment for everyone.

## Background and investigation

On Sat 13 January, 2024, the Community Affairs Team (CAT) discussed the banning of Marton Polgar (aka @2colours and @nemokosch) from the Raku-dev IRC channel by one of the channel's moderators.

Marton Polgar immediately after being banned from the channel created a formal issue (#57) on the `Raku/Raku-steering-council/ ` repository. Two individuals responded in their personal capacities as Raku Community members until the conversation began to go in circles.

The CAT also considered a search of IRC logs, a summary is appended below.

The CAT recognized that Marton Polgar has been an active contributor at Raku conferences and on line.

On balance and taking into account a pattern of interactions over time, the CAT decided on a ban from all Raku related spaces, and to inform other channels, such as Discord, that Marton Polgar is not welcome to Raku spaces.

This announcement references the [Raku Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Steering-Council/blob/main/papers/Raku_Code_of_Conduct.md).

The sanction is explicitly allowed for in the [COC incident response guide](https://github.com/Raku/Raku-Steering-Council/blob/main/papers/coc_incident_response_guide.md#allowed-responses).

The following summary of recent IRC logs was presented to CAT members. CAT members noted that these are not the only interactions they have noted over time.
