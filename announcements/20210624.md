24 June 2021 update on Raku Steering Council status
---------------------------------------------------

On June 22, 2021, the Raku Steering Council was informed of statements made by an RSC member,
Patrick Spek. After internal discussions, Patrick has resigned from the Raku Steering Council and
the RSC has accepted that resignation.

Out of consideration for the privacy of those involved, we ask members of the Raku community to
refrain from discussing the matter in Raku spaces. The RSC will fill the vacancy created by this
resignation in accordance with the procedures set out in the Raku Steering Council Code.
