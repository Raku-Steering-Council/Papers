# Raku Community to elect Raku Steering Council

[for immediate release]

A group of members of the Raku Community has come together to form a
preliminary Raku Steering Council, whose *only* job it is to organize
a formal Raku Steering Council Election according to the process
described in the [Raku Governance Model](https://github.com/Raku/RSC/blob/main/papers/Raku_Steering_Committee_Code.md).

These members are (in alphabetical order):
- Vadim Belman
- Alexander Kiryuhin
- Moritz Lenz
- Elizabeth Mattijsen
- JJ Merelo
- Claudio Ramirez
- Stefan Seifert
- Jonathan Worthington

Since there is no voting process installed yet, the voting for the first
elected Raku Steering Committee will be done by email.  Community member
Will Coleda, who has been Perl Foundation Grant Committee Manager in the
past, will perform the tallying of the votes.
