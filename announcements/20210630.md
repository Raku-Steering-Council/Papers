## Raku CAT Report 

On June 28, the Raku Community Affairs Team received a report of a recent incident and has now
completed its investigation. In that incident, a community member used a racial slur on a personal 
but publicly accessible website. The first "prohibited behavior" listed in the Raku Code of Conduct
is "using sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory language"; 
as explained in the CoC, that the statements are on a personal website is not a defense.

Accordingly, the community member is banned from all Raku spaces (both physical and virtual) for 
the six month period from July 1 to December 31, 2021.
