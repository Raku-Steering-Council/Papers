# Public Announcement

At its meeting on 21 February 2026, the Raku Community Affairs Team met to consider 
formal notifications that a community member had violated the Code of Conduct. 
The community member in question has just finished a two-year ban, and the 
interactions on line are similar to those which led to his two-year ban. 
The CAT is required to balance an individual's rights to freedom of expression, and 
also the effect on the Raku Community when freedom of expression goes beyond the 
Code of Ethics.

The CAT has decided to impose a permanent ban on Marton Polgar, 
aka @nemokosch and @2colours. Marton Polgar will not be allowed to take part in 
Raku community controlled spaces, including but not limited to IRC channels or 
Raku-org github repositories.
