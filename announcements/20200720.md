# Raku Community to elect Raku Steering Council

[for immediate release]

A group of members of the Raku Community has come together to form a
preliminary Raku Steering Council, whose *only* job it is to organize
a formal Raku Steering Council Election according to the process
described in the [Raku Governance Model](https://github.com/Raku/RSC/blob/main/papers/Raku_Steering_Committee_Code.md).

These members are (in alphabetical order):
- Vadim Belman
- Damian Conway
- Alexander Kiryuhin
- Moritz Lenz
- Elizabeth Mattijsen
- JJ Merelo
- Claudio Ramirez
- Stefan Seifert
- Jonathan Worthington

Since there is no voting process installed yet, the voting for the first
elected Raku Steering Committee will be done by email.  Community member
Will Coleda, who has been Perl Foundation Grant Committee Manager in the
past, will perform the tallying of the votes.

All people with a commit bit to the following repositories at the moment
of release of this announcement, have active and passive voting rights:

- [Rakudo](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo)
- [NQP](https://github.com/raku/nqp)
- [MoarVM](https://github.com/MoarVM/MoarVM)

Each person will only have one vote, even if they have commit bits to
more than one of these repositories.

If you would like to nominate yourself for the Raku Steering Council,
you should add a file to the:
  
  https://github.com/Raku/RSC/tree/main/nominations/2020

directory with your Github ID as the name of the file, and whatever
information you would like to make available to the voters to make them
vote for you.

The period to submit your nominations will start with this announcement
and will last until midnight UTC, August 2nd 2020.

This will be followed by a period of two weeks in which voting can be
done, so the voting will close by midnight UTC, August 16th 2020.

A formatted email template will be provided which voters can use to
assign a value of 1 through 5 to each of the candidates of their
choice.  A voter sends the email to will@coleda.com for this initial
election.

The result of the election will be announced by Will Coleda as soon
as possble after the voting has closed.

We hope that this will allow moving the Raku Programming Language
forward in these interesting times.

Stay healthy, stay safe!
