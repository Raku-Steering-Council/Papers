## Thanking Vadim Belman

The Raku Steering Council announces, with sadness and gratitude, that
Vadim Belman has resigned from the Raku Steering Council and the Raku
Community Affairs team due to limited availability.

Vadim has served on both the RSC and the CAT since their inception and
has always been a steady factor in meetings.

The RSC thanks Vadim for his service in the Raku Steering Council.
