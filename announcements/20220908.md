## Raku CAT Report

On September 6, the Raku Community Affairs Team received a report of a
recent incident and has now completed its investigation. In that
incident, a community member persistently engaged in a politically
charged debate in the #raku IRC channel despite being repeatedly
informed that the #raku channel was not an appropriate venue for
the topic.

One of the "prohibited behaviors" listed in the Raku Code of Conduct
is "continuing or repeatedly starting a conversation in an
inappropriate venue". Accordingly, the community member is banned from
all Raku spaces, both physical and virtual, for 7 days (from September
8 to September 15, 2022).  Additionally, the community member is
placed on probation for 3 months (from September 8 to December 7,
2022).  During that probationary period, any violations of the Raku
Code of Conduct, even if very minor, will lead to bans or other
serious consequences.
