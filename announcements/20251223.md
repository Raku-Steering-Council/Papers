## Thanking Stefan Seifert

The Raku Steering Council announces, with sadness and gratitude, that
Stefan Seifert has resigned from the Raku Steering Council and the Raku
Community Affairs team due to limited availability

Stefan has served on both the RSC and the CAT since their inception and
has always been a voice of reason in meetings.

The RSC thanks Stefan for his service in the Raku Steering Council.

The remaining council members have decided to **not** fill the open seat for now, with a review of the situation in 6 months.

Therefore the current Raku Steering Council now consists of (in alphabetical order):

- Geoffrey Broadwell
- Richard Hainsworth
- John Haltiwanger
- Nick Logan
- Elizabeth Mattijsen
- Daniel Sockwell
