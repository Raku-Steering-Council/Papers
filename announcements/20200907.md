9 September 2020 update on Raku Steering Council status
-------------------------------------------------------

Jonathan Worthington has indicated that they are currently not in a position to fulfill the council member role in the Raku Steering Council: https://6guts.wordpress.com/2020/10/05/taking-a-break-from-raku-core-development/ .

The remaining council members have asked Vadim Belman (the next person in the election with regards to number of votes) if they'd be willing to take a seat in the council.  They affirmed that they would.

The remaining council members then took a vote whether to accept Vadim Belman into the Raku Steering Council.  This vote was unanimously accepted.

Therefore the current Raku Steering Council now consists of (in alphabetical order):

- Aleks-Daniel Jakimenko-Aleksejev
- Vadim Belman
- Nick Logan
- Elizabeth Mattijsen
- JJ Merelo
- Stefan Seifert
- Daniel Sockwell
