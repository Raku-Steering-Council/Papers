8 June 2023 update on Raku Steering Council status
---------------------------------------------------

Richard Hainsworth, recently very much involved with the Raku Programming Language documentation effort, has accepted the invitation by the Raku Steering Council to become a member.  Originally on the [ballot list in 2020](../nominations/2020/results.txt), they described themselves as having a passion for Raku, and a desire to facilitate an ongoing friendly and supportive community.

The remaining council members have taken a vote whether to accept Richard Hainsworth into the Raku Steering Council.  This vote was unanimously accepted.

Therefore the current Raku Steering Council now consists of (in alphabetical order):

- Vadim Belman
- Geoffrey Broadwell
- Richard Hainsworth
- Nick Logan
- Elizabeth Mattijsen
- Stefan Seifert
- Daniel Sockwell
