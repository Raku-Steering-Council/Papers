# My nomination

I'd like to nominate myself as a member of RSC.
I have a breadth of knowledge in various areas from
development to devops. Working in small product
companies and large outsource ones targeted for enterprise
level. 

Getting familiar with different approaches
professional societies and cultures.

I believe in the idea of Raku being a great language
through a unified community and healthy relationship 
within this community. 

I hope I might be helpful and useful with
that respect.

Best regards.
