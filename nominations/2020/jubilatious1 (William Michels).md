William Michels, Ph.D.

Greetings: I hope Raku core members would please consider me as a candidate for the Raku Steering Council. 

My background is as a biomedical research scientist, so I know first-hand the difficulties research professionals encounter in designing reliable and reproducible data workflows. At the moment I do a lot of Data Science programming in R and MySQL. In developing my skill-set, I recognized a need to develop more systems-level and text-processing "Command Line Fu". Looking at the available options (Bash scripting, Awk, Sed, Perl5), Raku was clearly the best choice.

Certainly a major role for the Raku Steering Council will be in community outreach, therefore voting members may need to consider what academic/business sector(s) Raku is best suited for. I would love to see Raku accepted in academia, and my background would be helpful in this regard. Also I would love to see bioinformaticians and Data Scientists adopt Raku. I believe that as a member of the RSC I would be well-positioned to help.

In conclusion, I believe the RSC should try its best to represent the whole Raku Community, a community that communicates in different formats and with different time-frames. As a newcomer, I decidedly fall into the "weekly" (non-daily) part of the Raku community: I regularly attend our weekly Raku Meetup in California, and have done so since 2018. I contribute many times per week to the Perl6-Users (Raku) mailing list by answering question from fellow newcomers, and also by posing questions of my own. Finally, I've begun posting Raku answers to older (typically sed/awk) text-processing questions on StackOverflow, in the hopes of attracting new people to the language.

Thank you for your consideration.
