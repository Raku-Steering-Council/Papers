# Juan Julián Merelo Guervós

I'd like Raku to be a popular language among the teaching community and hobbyists, first and foremost. That can bootstrap it to fame, I guess.

Anyway, I love to be in charge (ish) of documentation, and like to look at derelict issues, PRs and community modules. So I'd be honored to be a part of the SC, and will try to serve the community as such.
