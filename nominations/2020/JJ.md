# Juan-Julián Merelo-Guervós

I'd like Raku to be a popular language among the teaching community and hobbyists, first and foremost. That can bootstrap it to fame, I guess.

Anyway, I love to be in charge (ish) of documentation, and like to look at derelict issues, PRs and community modules. So I'd be honored to be a part of the SC, and will try to serve the community as such.

## A bit about me

I'm professor at the [University of Granada](https://www.ugr.es), where I studied theoretical physics and teach at the Computer Architecture lab. I also write novels, non-fiction and technical manuals from time to time. My [GitHub profile is JJ](https://github.com/JJ) and [I'm JJ5 at GitLab](https://gitlab.com/JJ5) (came a bit late there).

## Me and Perl and Raku

I've been working with Perl since circa 1992, with Raku since 2016 approximately. I've also been involved in outreach efforts for the Perl Foundation, including a succesful Google Summer of Code request and a failed one.

I'm [JMERELO at CPAN](https://metacpan.org/author/JMERELO), where I've published more than a dozen modules, including one that includes, in its text, a whole novel. I was the main organizer of [YAPC 2015 in Granada](https://metacpan.org/release/YAPC-Europe-UGR), and have participated in many others YAPC-Europe, the first one in Münich in 2002. Throughout all these YAPCs, I've talked *a lot* about evolutionary algorithms. I still use Perl routinely, now mainly as my second language.

My main language is now Raku, and I've been, apparently by default, involved with [the documentation](https://docs.raku.org) since I worked the grant I got from the Perl Foundation in early 2018. But I've also worked in the community modules, the Raku ecosystem, and many others bits and odds of the Raku community (including, for some time, the extraofficially official release announcement in Twitter and lately the Advent Calendar and 20th anniversary calendar).

## What I bring to the RSC

I guess that the academic perspective might be interesting, since briging Raku into universities might boost its popularity. Also, experience in outreach efforts. May I say also my love and passion for Raku and the community?
