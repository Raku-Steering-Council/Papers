I am willing to serve on the Raku steering council, should it be the wish of the Raku community. I would
bring my experience and perspectives as:

* A Rakudo contributor since 2008
* The founder and architect of MoarVM
* The designer of various Raku concurrency features
* The product owner of the Comma IDE
* The designer of the Cro libraries for building web services and applications in Raku
* Lead developer of the RakuAST effort to bring a user-facing AST and powerful macros to Raku
