As a long time Perl programmer I couldn't wait until Christmas and so regularly read the IRC logs over the years. 

It was inspiring to see Perl 6, and recently Raku, take shape - I'm passionate about seeing Raku flourish. 

As a former barrister specialising in intellectual property I can offer support to the steering council to help protect Raku's IP and promote its growth.

Recently I joined The Perl Foundation's marketing committee to help promote Raku and the other TPF brands and projects (e.g., TPF, Perl 7, Perl Legacy, meta::cpan etc). 
The committee is actively reaching out to the software communities we serve. As a member of the Raku Steering Council I will work with the TPF to 
ensure Raku is fully supported.
