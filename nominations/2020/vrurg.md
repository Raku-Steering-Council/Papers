# Vadim Belman

Raku is more than just a language. First and foremost, it's a community, a
philosophy, and a vision. It's a system which grows. I believe in the Steering
Council to be the right way to help it grow and develop. I would like to
contribute my skills and experience to The Raku language and the community by
being an elected member of the Council.
