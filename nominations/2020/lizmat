Elizabeth Mattijsen

I would like to make myself available as a member of the Raku
Steering Council.  I think I will be able to make the Raku Programming
Language an even better place to develop applications for the world.

In the past, I have been involved in organizing two YAPC::Europe
conferences and many workshops.  I have represented both Perl and Raku
at many open source events, such as FOSDEM, OSCON, FrosCON and T-Dose.

I have been involved with what is now the Raku Programming Language
since it initial conception as Perl 6 in 2000, but sadly had to be on
hiatus from 2001 to 2012.  After having organized the Perl Reunification
Summit just before the YAPC::Europe in 2012, I became more involved with
the development of the Raku Programming Language itself and have since
then become the most prolific committer to the Rakudo repository.

I have also been writing a weekly blog about developments in the Raku
world for the past 5 years, as well as many advent blog posts.

I currently do not share an employer with any of the other candidates.
