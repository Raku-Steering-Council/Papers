# Patrick Spek

I've been a Raku user starting from its official release in 2015. Since then,
I've tried to make contributions to help the community grow and help out
others.

I'm currently in charge of several IRC bots in the Raku IRC channels, as well
as the Rakudo Star distribution (for GNU+Linux, at least). In addition, I have
a reasonable number of modules in the ecosystem.

In addition, I've also helped out at the Perl & Raku booth at FOSDEM and other
events a couple times, and have showcased Raku a number of times at local
meetups. The Amsterdam.pm meetup is hosted at my company's office.

A number of my blogposts about Raku have been noted in the Rakudo Weekly blog
post as well.

My perspective on the Raku Steering Council can help understand a younger
generation, and what they would like in a language. My aim is to help new
programmers understand how Raku works, and get them interested in learning
more. I hope my contributions can be helpful in getting more people to consider
(and use) Raku for their next projects.
