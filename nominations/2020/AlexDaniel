Aleks-Daniel Jakimenko-Aleksejev

Even though Raku was started many years ago, even to this day it has
an uncontrolled growth in all of the areas. More and more things are
constantly being added on top of what already exists, with little to
no thought on how the resulting monstrosity will work when everything
is combined together.

This repo is a prime example of that. If nominated, I will do my best
to remove the Raku-Steering-Council repo, because we already have the
problem-solving repo. Without this, the repos will conflict with each
other. I agree that some good ideas can be introduced into the
existing process, and interested parties are free to do at any time,
but this can be done using what already exists.
