If selected, I would be happy to serve on the Raku Steering Council.

As an early adopter of Perl 6, I've been blogging, talking about,
and writing Raku since the first release. I've also been organizing
and participating in local meetings.

As a member of the council, I would try to make decisions that help
Raku continue to be a fun and powerful language, and to help it
to obtain further adoption by developers.  I would make decisions
that promote a thriving and welcoming Raku community.

Thank you for your consideration!
