Richard Hainsworth (aka finanalyst)

I have been following the progress of Perl6/Raku since the very first RFCs. Of all the languages I have used since I came across computers 
in my teens (30-odd years ago), Raku is my favourite. I use it whenever I need to solve a problem.

The skills and experiences I offer to the Raku Steering Council include: writing the founding documents for the CFA Association of Russia (we had to take 
the US standard Articles of Association and adapt them to Russian realities), serving on elected consultative decision-making bodies for several decades in my
faith community (the Baha'i Faith, should you be interested), a passion for Raku, a desire to facilitate an ongoing friendly and supportive community.
