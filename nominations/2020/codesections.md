From a purely technical level, I am not the most qualified person to serve on
the Raku Steering Council.  If you were selecting candidates with the deepest
knowledge of the Raku language or the longest membership in the Raku community,
then you wouldn't select me.

Nevertheless, there are three reasons why selecting me for the RSC would benefit
the Raku community:

 * **The perspective of a new user**: I know what it is like to come to Raku in
   2020; I just did so myself.  I appreciate exactly where the roadblocks – and
   the delights! – can be.  I have tremendous respect for those who have been
   coding Raku for years, and I have a lot to learn from them.  Yet, for Raku to
   have the impact it deserves, we'll need to appeal to developers who program
   in other languages, including not only Perl but also as many other languages
   as possible.  Unlike 81.5% of the respondents to the [recent user
   survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRPBdn1iRN_sT8BMNMOBhVbEY1u8ngZWVwLyM37sqsa4OLwQ/viewanalytics),
   I did not come to Raku with extensive Perl experience – or indeed any at all.
   Instead, the two languages I've programmed professionally are JavaScript (the
   [most widely
   used](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies)
   programming language) and Rust (a quickly growing language that StackOverflow
   users have selected as their [most loved
   language](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted)
   for five years in a row).  I very much hope to help our language grow by
   bringing these perspective to the RSC.

 * **Excitement, energy, and time**: I am a self-employed software developer in
   my early 30s and work full time developing Free/Open Source Software.  I
   firmly believe that Raku is a tremendous contribution to the FOSS community,
   and am currently [devoting a significant amount of my
   time](https://github.com/Raku/doc/graphs/contributors?from=2020-08-09&to=2020-09-20&type=c)
   to improving the language and ecosystem in any way I can – and I'm just
   getting started.  Being able to focus on free software without the time
   commitment of a $DAYJOB is, to put it mildly, _extremely_ helpful.

 * **I'm also an attorney**: The RSC, in addition to providing technical
   leadership, will likely also confront more mundane, administrative tasks.  I
   believe my background could be helpful here.  Before discovering my passion
   for coding and free software, I worked as an attorney at [one of the most
   well-regarded law firms](https://www.davispolk.com/firm) in New York City.
   Though I've maintained my law license, I no longer practice law and wouldn't
   be interested in representing the RSC.  Still, having a perspective on US law
   could be helpful – after all, legal and licensing issues [do come
   up](https://github.com/Raku/problem-solving/issues/193) from time to time.

Whether or not I am selected for the RSC, I look forward to contributing to the
Raku community in the months and years ahead.  Just yesterday, my first Rakudo
pull request [was merged](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/pull/3878), and my
first blog post about Raku was featured in the [Rakudo weekly
news](https://rakudoweekly.blog/2020/08/31/2020-35-election-candidacies/).  I am
sure that both will be just the first of many, and I look forward to building
our language together.
